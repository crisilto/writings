        you were the only one <br>
        who saw my worth<br>
        i know you were wrong<br>
        since you are gone<br>
        how could you be right<br>
        if no one else ever did<br>
        you were just blind<br>
        trying to make me feel whole<br>
        in a world<br>
        where i am the hole<br>
    </p>

        <span class="title-poem">#4</span><br>
        when i see the mirror <br>
        i don't recognize the reflection <br>
        when i hear my voice <br>
        i only feel rejection <br>
        even air <br>
        feels wrong in my chest <br>
        how could someone like this <br>
        deserve to be <br>
    </p>
