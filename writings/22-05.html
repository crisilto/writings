        people come to my life<br>
        they swear they are comfortable in it<br>
        but i'm already standing at the door with a knife<br>
        waiting for them to leave<br>
        because that would be easier to bear
    </p>

        <span class="title-poem">#2</span><br>
        when i try to sleep<br>
        and silence my mind<br>
        the voices return<br>
        louder than mine<br>
        how can i rest<br>
        if nothing is still<br>
        how can i live<br>
        if all i know is grief
    </p>
